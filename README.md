A clean and nice web portfolio for me. That includes HTML, CSS and  JavaScript. At first, in the first section include about me, links to social networks and a great image. Then the About section displays more information about me. Then my objective, about cyber security.  Then the list of Skills it offers. It also has a section where i include my academic projects. And at the bottom it has a form for contact with me, and at the end i added a footer.

This is portfolio is fully responsive.
